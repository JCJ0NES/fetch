# fetch json application
Here you will find an android application that takes a json from the web and makes it into a scrollable list of groups. Each group is sorted by their listId and the elements of the groups are sorted by their id which is the same as the number in their name, so I used that. Cool. I used this project to familiarize myself with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.
